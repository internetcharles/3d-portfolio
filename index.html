        Hi, I'm Charlie. I'm a full stack developer and game programmer/designer 
        based out of Portland, OR. I love to create interesting experiences for 
        anyone who comes across my work. Basically I live to create cool things.
        I don't think there are many limitations to what one person can achieve if
        they have faith in themselves and their ideas! By the way, this site was made
        using THREE.js and vanilla JavaScript. It's still under construction, so visit
        again sometime, yeah?
